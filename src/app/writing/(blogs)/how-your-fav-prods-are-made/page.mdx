While updating my portfolio website, I realized my skills were pretty similar to those of a product designer. However, I didn’t know much about designing physical products, which sparked my curiosity. I took it upon myself to learn how they are made, and here’s a simplified version of everything I learnt.

## **Starting with a Problem or Idea**

It all begins with a problem or a new idea. You might notice something that doesn’t work as well as it should or think of a new way to solve an existing issue. For example, you might notice that the takeout boxes for waakye are awkward, hard to use and inefficient. So, you may want to redesign the packaging, looking at what’s already available, and talking to people to understand their needs and frustrations.

## **Sketching Out Concepts**

Once you have a good grasp of the problem, you start sketching out ideas. This is where you can show off your drawing skills. You draw different shapes and designs, imagining how your product could work and what it might look like. It’s a chance to experiment and think outside the box (literally), without worrying too much about the details just yet.

## **Building a Prototype**

With a solid concept in mind, the next step is to create a prototype. This is a rough version of your product, made from materials like cardboard, clay, or even 3D-printed parts. In this example, we could use foam or cardboard for the prototype, as it’s easy and quick to work with. The prototype helps you visualize your design in three dimensions and test out its functionality. It’s not about perfection at this stage—it’s about getting a feel for how your product will work in real life.

## **Refining the Design**

After testing your prototype, you refine the design. This involves making detailed drawings and using software like CAD to create precise models. You think carefully about every aspect, from the materials you’ll use to the product’s dimensions and how it will be manufactured. For example, you might adjust the size and shape to make sure it’s comfortable to use and can be produced efficiently. In this stage, it’s also very easy to forget about design the little yet important bits like hinges and joints. In our waakye packaging example, we might need to design a joint system, or we can use an existing one, if it’s up to our standards.

## **Testing and Feedback**

Once you have a refined prototype, it’s time to test it thoroughly. You evaluate how well it works and see if it meets the requirements you’ve set. You might ask people to try it out and give you feedback on what they like and what could be improved. This helps you identify any issues and make adjustments to improve the product.

## **Finalizing the Design**

With feedback and testing complete, you finalize your design. This involves creating detailed specifications and choosing the best materials and manufacturing processes. You work out the final dimensions, select materials that offer the right balance of durability and cost, and make sure everything is ready for production.

## **Manufacturing and Launching**

Finally, your product is ready for manufacturing. You work with factories to produce it, ensuring that it meets all your specifications and quality standards. You also plan how to get your product to customers, from packaging to distribution. For example, if you’ve designed a new kitchen gadget, you’d make sure it’s packaged securely and figure out the best way to get it onto store shelves or into customers’ hands.

## **Conclusion**

Creating hardware products is a journey that combines creativity, technical skills, and a deep understanding of user needs. Each step, from identifying a problem to refining the design and bringing the product to market, is crucial to turning an idea into a successful, real-world product.
